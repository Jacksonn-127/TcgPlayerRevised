Looking up the price of my Trading cards every single time I thought about them took too long about 60 seconds per card.

This is a small program to automatically find the market price of: single cards, graded single cards, or sealed collectible boxes.

This reduces search time from 60 seconds to just 2 seconds a 97.77% time saver per item.

You will either need a browser and it's associated selenium web driver.

Please ensure you have added your Chromedriver.exe to the chromeDriver/chromedriver-win64 folder. The output will be an .csv file with all the prices of your current collection.

Currently on hold while I work on school.
