Manually checking the price of my collectible trading cards takes hours. To save myself the headache I developed a webscraper to do it for me. 

This is a small program to automatically find the market price of: single cards, graded single cards, or sealed collectible boxes.

This reduces search time from 60 seconds to just 2 seconds a 96.77% time saver per item.

You will either need a browser and it's associated selenium web driver.

Please ensure you have added your Chromedriver.exe to the chromeDriver/chromedriver-win64 folder. The output will be an .csv file with all the prices of your current collection.

Currently on hold while I work on school. Next feature to implement is reading links from url, and then front end dashboard.
